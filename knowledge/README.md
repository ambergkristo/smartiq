# Knowledge Seeds

`smartiq_factory.py` bootstraps local seed files in this directory on first run:

- `knowledge/culture.json`
- `knowledge/history.json`
- `knowledge/geography.json`
- `knowledge/science.json`
- `knowledge/sports.json`
- `knowledge/technology.json`
- `knowledge/art.json`
- `knowledge/music.json`
- `knowledge/politics.json`
- `knowledge/nature.json`

These files provide local anchor pools used by Agent 1 for deterministic card generation.
